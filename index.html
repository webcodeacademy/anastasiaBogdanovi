            <h2>10 Things No One Tells You About the Wedding Day</h2>
            <p class="entry">
            No matter how many weddings you've attended before, or how many times you've been a bridesmaid, there are some things you just don't find out about until your wedding day. <br>Talk to anyone who's gone through it before and they'll tell you that your wedding day absolutely flies by. You'll be so busy going from one thing to the next that before you know it, you'll be cutting the cake. You may already know that you need an emergency kit (just in case), that it can be difficult to use the bathroom in your ball gown, and to pack a stain remover. But aside from the logistics, there are tons of intangible, special moments that make up the wedding day itself. Here, 10 truths about the wedding day that no one ever talks about.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h3>&#49;&#8228; Ten minutes before the ceremony is the most nerve-racking part&#8228;</h3>
            <p>
                The time leading up to the walk down the aisle will be the most anxiety-ridden 10 minutes you'll ever have. And it makes sense—you're about to make a life-changing decision in front of all the people you love and care about the most. Just remember that your other half is waiting for you at the end of the journey and you're going to have a huge party to celebrate (not to mention the reason why you said "yes" in the first place).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>&#50;&#8228; The ceremony is the best part&#8228;</h3>
            <p>
                There's something truly amazing about the wedding ceremony. The traditions, the vows and all your emotional family members and friends make it one of the most special moments of your life. Our advice? Take it all in and drink it up. You'll want these memories to last a lifetime.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>&#51;&#8228; You'll definitely cry&#8228;</h3>
            <p>
                Okay, this one might not be such a secret—all we can say is that crying is basically inevitable. And since you already know the waterworks are coming, the best thing to do is just be prepared. Store some tissues nearby, and if you're a bride, make sure to wear waterproof makeup (or even get eyelash extensions) and keep some mascara and lipstick readily available for quick touch-ups.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>&#52;&#8228; Your face will hurt from smiling so much&#8228;</h3>
            <p>
                Thousands of pictures aside, you'll be smiling all day because it's going to be the best day ever. You're marrying your best friend, after all! Between finally "making it official" with your partner and dancing like crazy with all of your close friends and family, there's literally no reason to frown (even if it rains).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>&#53;&#8228; You'll be amazed by the love and support of your family and friends&#8228;</h3>
            <p>
                They all showed up for one reason—you! You and your soon-to-be spouse will get all—and we really mean all—of the attention. You may not even be able to eat dinner, since you'll have so many people to talk to and so many pictures to take. Between the pinches on the cheek from your grandma and the side-punches from your college pals, you'll be overcome by the love and support of those around you.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>&#54;&#8228; You'll want a little alone time&#8228;</h3>
            <p>
                In fact, you might be so overcome with emotion that you may want to take a few moments just for you, or the two of you. Some of the most special minutes of the day are the few you get to spend alone, preparing for what's to come, or together with your new spouse, taking it all in.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>&#55;&#8228; You might be a little exhausted&#8228;</h3>
            <p>
                Let's face it, you won't get too much sleep the night before your wedding. Between stressing over the seating chart, a tiff with your mom or just overall excitement for the day to come, you'll be seriously lacking in shut-eye. Pro tip: Under-eye concealer will be your best friend.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>&#56;&#8228; It won't all go as planned&#8228;</h3>
            <p>
                Something might end up going wrong. It could be little, or it could be big, but our best advice is to soldier on and try to think of the big picture. Can you solve this problem easily? Does it make a huge difference in the long run? Are your guests still having fun? Are you having fun? If these questions are easily answered, then don't sweat it—just keep enjoying your celebration, and feel free to delegate tasks to planners and relatives so you don't have to deal with drama.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>&#57;&#8228; The most magical moment will be when you least expect it&#8228;</h3>
            <p>
                We promise that the most special time of the day, or weekend, is going to be something you never expected. A stolen minute or two with your soon-to-be spouse, a hug from your dad or an impromptu speech by your college roommate could end up meaning the world to you.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>&#49;&#48;&#8228; You'll feel different&#8228;</h3>
            <p>
                Even if you and your other half have been cohabiting for years, once you're legally wed, things will feel official. It might just be a slight shift or it could feel like a noticeable change, but it will definitely seem like the real deal—because it is!
